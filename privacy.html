  <h1>Privacy Policy for Backstage</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 19, 2025</p>
  <p class="muted">Backstage (also referred to as “Bckstge”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use our mobile application and related websites (collectively, the “Service”).</p>

  <h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Account &amp; Profile</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Name, email address, display name, and other identifiers you provide when you create an account or contact support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Payments (Apple Pay &amp; Stripe)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We process payments using <strong>Apple Pay</strong> and <strong>Stripe</strong>. We do <em>not</em> store full payment card numbers or CVV on our servers.</li>
      <li>Apple Pay and/or Stripe may collect payment details to complete the transaction; we receive tokenized payment confirmations and transaction metadata (e.g., success/failure, last 4 digits, card brand) necessary for receipts, refunds, and fraud prevention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Usage &amp; Analytics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>App interactions (screens viewed, features used), performance data (crash logs), and basic event metrics to improve reliability and product experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Device &amp; Technical</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Device model, operating system version, app version, language/region, IP address, and similar diagnostic data to maintain compatibility and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Location (Optional)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you grant permission, we may collect approximate location to show nearby venues and events. You can disable location sharing in your device settings at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Audio Recognition (ShazamKit)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To power the “Now Playing” feature, we use Apple’s <strong>ShazamKit</strong>. Audio is analyzed locally on your device. We do <em>not</em> record, store, or transmit raw audio. Only recognized track metadata (e.g., title/artist) may be displayed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Guest Mode / Explore Without Account</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You may explore parts of the Service without creating an account. Guest Mode may display limited or locally cached content and does not create a persistent profile on our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cookies &amp; Local Storage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We may use cookies and local storage to remember preferences, keep you signed in, and measure site performance on our web pages.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Service (including purchases, tickets, and access to venue information).</li>
    <li>Improve reliability, performance, and user experience; develop new features.</li>
    <li>Process payments and prevent fraud (via Apple Pay and Stripe).</li>
    <li>Provide support and respond to inquiries.</li>
    <li>Enforce terms, protect the Service and our users, and comply with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) When We Share Information</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or rent personal data. We may share information only with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers</strong> acting on our behalf (e.g., Stripe for payments, Firebase services for authentication, hosting, analytics; Apple frameworks such as ShazamKit). These providers are required to use data only to perform services for us and to implement reasonable safeguards.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal/Safety</strong> when required by law, valid legal process, or to protect rights, safety, and property.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong> in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets. Where required, you will be notified.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Payments &amp; Financial Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple Pay:</strong> Card details are handled by Apple and your card issuer. We receive tokenized confirmations necessary to complete your order and issue receipts/refunds.</li>
    <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> Stripe securely processes payments; we do not store full card numbers or CVV. We receive transaction metadata (e.g., payment status, last 4 digits, brand) for accounting and support.</li>
    <li>Transaction records are retained to comply with tax, accounting, and anti-fraud obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account/profile data: kept while your account is active. If you request deletion, we delete or anonymize your data except where retention is required by law (e.g., fraud prevention, accounting).</li>
    <li>Payment/transaction records: retained for as long as legally required for bookkeeping and tax (often up to 7 years, depending on jurisdiction).</li>
    <li>Usage/diagnostic logs: typically retained for up to 24 months to improve stability and security.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access/Update:</strong> You can access or update your account information in-app or by contacting us.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete Account:</strong> You may request deletion by contacting support. Some information may be retained where required by law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g., chargebacks, fraud prevention, or accounting).</li>
    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can disable location or microphone permissions in device settings; related features may become unavailable.</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> You may opt out of marketing emails via the unsubscribe link or by contacting support.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy Rights:</strong> Depending on your location, you may have additional rights (e.g., to request access, correction, deletion, portability, and to object/restrict certain processing). To exercise these, contact us using the details below.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information (e.g., encryption in transit (TLS), access controls). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we work continuously to improve our defenses.</p>

  <h2>8) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us and we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>9) International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>We may process and store information in countries other than your own. Where applicable, we implement appropriate safeguards to protect your information in accordance with this Policy and applicable law.</p>

  <h2>10) Do Not Track</h2>
  <p>Some browsers offer “Do Not Track” signals. Because there is no common industry standard, we do not currently respond to these signals. We will review and update this Policy if standards emerge.</p>

  <h2>11) Third-Party Services We Use</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apple Pay:</strong> Payment tokenization and authorization handled by Apple and your card issuer. We don’t store raw card data.</li>
      <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> Payment processing and transaction management. Stripe may collect limited payer information to process payments and prevent fraud.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Authentication, hosting, analytics, and related infrastructure services that help us operate the app reliably and securely.</li>
      <li><strong>ShazamKit (Apple):</strong> On-device audio recognition to display currently playing track metadata in participating venues. Raw audio is not stored or transmitted.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>12) Guest Mode (Non-Account Access)</h2>
  <p>You may access certain non-account features without registration. Guest Mode is designed to allow exploration of app functionality without creating a profile. Some advanced features (e.g., purchases, saved items, follows) require an account.</p>

  <h2>13) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will provide notice through the app, by email, or on our website. The “Effective Date” above reflects the latest version.</p>
